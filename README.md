## Random Greasemonkey Scripts
* `cvmaps.gs.js` - Show maps on jobseeking websites (only supporting CWJobs for now). Hover above the 'map' text next to any given location on search pages to show a map you can interact with, until you move the mouse outside of the map. You need to generate your own Google API key through Google first, then add it and your current location to the map query paramters in the script. Failure to do so means the script will not work. Future modifications may involve asking the user for these details without storing them in the script.
